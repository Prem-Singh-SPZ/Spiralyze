<p style="color: #0d0b16;">While Kong has strong brand recognition, they haven't focused on keeping their API Management and Gateway solutions up to date for modern use cases. Kong doesn't own their stack, and their Gateway is built on a pure HTTP, point-to-point-only solution, which severely limits support for asynchronous and event-driven APIs.</p>
<p style="color: #0d0b16;">In contrast, Graviteeâ€™s enterprise API Management platform is designed with flexibility at its core, providing solutions to manage, secure, and govern both synchronous and asynchronous APIs on a single platform. Combined with an extremely robust open-source solution for smaller use cases, Gravitee is an excellent choice for teams of any size.</p>
